# Todo-List
TOP Project


1. If user adds new project, hide todo-item div.
2. When swapping between projects with todos, default the current shown todo as the first one.
3. Add highlighted effectt to current todo
4. So we want to have the currently selected todo thats highlighted to keep its class when we swap between projects.
5. Maybe we have some kind of true/false flag on the todo object to track that?
6. When adding a new todo it also changes the todo information to that new todo
